This repository contains the results of tasks completed during my Codsoft internship.

Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction – Built a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to predict passenger survival based on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction – Developed a model using Linear Regression to predict movie ratings from the IMDB dataset. Processed and visualized data, performed feature engineering, and evaluated model performance.

Task 3: IRIS Flower Classification – Implemented multiple classification algorithms to categorize Iris flowers using a Kaggle dataset. Random Forest performed best in training, while Logistic Regression showed better accuracy in both training and testing.
